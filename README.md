E-Ramen is a project created for the Human-Computer Interaction course assessment, and it marks my first project. ERamen shop is one of the oldest ramen shops in the world, established in 1910 in Japan and introduced to Indonesia in 2015. Since ERamen has been around for a long time, the shop plans to revamp its website to provide a fresh atmosphere for customers. The website consists of five pages: a home page, a menu page, a special offer page, an about us page, and a contact us page.
